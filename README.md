# Morse Auto-Incorrect

One of the first methods of long distance **communication** was Morse code. Our deck **translates** Morse code into text, and can even **auto-~correct~incorrect**!

Auto Incorrect is a Morse code translator that purposely misinterprets the Morse code it receives by changing what was input to something random and displaying it on the screen. It has a button to input the Morse code, a speaker that plays the Morse code in real time as you input it, and a screen that displays the Morse code and word as you are typing it, and when you are done, it will auto-incorrect it.
