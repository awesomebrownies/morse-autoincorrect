Welcome to the firmware section!

To flash the orpheus pico (the raspberry pi pico equivalent), you'll need **Arduino IDE**.

There are a couple of different functionalities within the firmware, I'll go over them below.

* Physical Component Management
* Screen Rendering
* Autocorrect
* Morse Code Translation

Feel free to look through the code, and good luck!
