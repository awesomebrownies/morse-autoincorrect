Log #1. Our main objective was to create a circuit that utilized the speakers. Our first hassle was the infinitely long lines of the undercity. Many scavengers scrounged the streets towards the hardware sanctuary.

*2 hours theorizing the perfect idea*

*Unfortunately* the large sign out front said **SINGLE FILE LINE**

This delayed the inevitable adventure, as our frantic petrifying speed made the components we need fly off back on the shelves. 

*1.5 hours spent in line*

Log #2: To create the mechanism, we constructed off a audio amplifier out of towers of solder, each pin at a time. Once finished the swarming spaghetti monster of breadboards consumed our work. The spaghetti was weak, and easily shifted. More importantly, the communication channels within, our **firmware**, had a fatal flaw. Evan worked on the first mechanism. *the button*. This was no ordinary button. As it refused to work despite every effort, neither towards staff member or any helping hand.

*4 hours exterminating the bugs within the code*

Log #3: 

```cpp
#include <I2S.h>

const int bclkPin = D2;   // BCLK
const int lrckPin = D3;   // LRC (WS)
const int dinPin  = D4;   // Data (SD)
const int butPin = D5;

const int frequency = 440; 
const int amplitude = 5000; 
const int sampleRate = 16000;

const int halfWavelength = (sampleRate / frequency); // half wavelength of square wave

int16_t sample = amplitude; // current sample value
int count = 0;

I2S i2s(OUTPUT);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  i2s.setBCLK(bclkPin);
  i2s.setDATA(dinPin);
  i2s.setBitsPerSample(16);

  if (!i2s.begin(44100)) {
    Serial.println("Failed to initialize I2S!");
    while (1);
  }
  pinMode(butPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
}

void loop() {

  if (count % halfWavelength == 0) {
    sample = -1 * sample;
  }

  i2s.write(sample);
  i2s.write(sample);

  count++;

  // test button
  if (digitalRead(butPin)) {
    Serial.println("HI");
    Serial.println(count);
  }
}
